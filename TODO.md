# TODO – Conversion & Performance (Landing + Blog)

Status as of today

- [x] Dual-CTA in hero (Book a Demo + Watch Live Demo)
- [x] Gate interactive demo behind intent (lazy import + poster)
- [x] Neutral placeholder for demo while loading
- [x] Blog sticky CTA while reading (Book a Demo)
- [x] End-of-post CTA on blog articles (dual actions)
- [ ] Reduce Hick’s Law load further: simplify hero choices into compact segmented control
- [x] Add short testimonial quotes near the fold
- [~] Animation polish: reveal-on-scroll with reduced motion support across sections (added for testimonials; extend to more sections)
- [x] Image performance pass: ensure AVIF/WEBP, srcset/sizes, priority only for critical images (added sizes to blog hero)

Notes

- Keep design language: clean, glassy, subtle gradients; 200ms transitions; accessible focus rings.
- Track CTR deltas for the two hero CTAs and blog CTAs.
